# autoresearch — Baseline

This is an experiment to have the LLM do its own research.

## Setup

1. Verify you are on the correct experiment branch.
2. Read the in-scope files for full context:
   - `README.md` — repository context.
   - `prepare.py` — fixed constants, data prep, tokenizer, dataloader, evaluation. Do not modify.
   - `train.py` — the file you modify. Model architecture, optimizer, training loop.
3. Verify data exists: Check that `~/.cache/autoresearch/` contains data shards and a tokenizer. If not, tell the human to run `uv run prepare.py`.
4. Initialize `results.tsv` with just the header row. The baseline will be recorded after the first run.
5. Confirm and go.

## Experimentation

Each experiment runs on a single GPU. The training script runs for a **fixed time budget of 5 minutes** (wall clock training time, excluding startup/compilation). You launch it simply as: `uv run train.py`.

**What you CAN do:**
- Modify `train.py` — this is the only file you edit. Everything is fair game: model architecture, optimizer, hyperparameters, training loop, batch size, model size, etc.

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Modify `prepare.py`. It is read-only. It contains the fixed evaluation, data loading, tokenizer, and training constants (time budget, sequence length, etc).
- Install new packages or add dependencies. You can only use what's already in `pyproject.toml`.
- Modify the evaluation harness. The `evaluate_bpb` function in `prepare.py` is the ground truth metric.

**The goal is simple: get the lowest val_bpb.** Since the time budget is fixed, you don't need to worry about training time — it's always 5 minutes. Everything is fair game: change the architecture, the optimizer, the hyperparameters, the batch size, the model size. The only constraint is that the code runs without crashing and finishes within the time budget.

**VRAM** is a soft constraint. Some increase is acceptable for meaningful val_bpb gains, but it should not blow up dramatically.

**Simplicity criterion**: All else being equal, simpler is better. A small improvement that adds ugly complexity is not worth it. Conversely, removing something and getting equal or better results is a great outcome — that's a simplification win.

## Decision Strategy

You have full autonomy. There are no prescribed decision rules. Use your own reasoning and intuition to:
- Analyze the current state of `train.py` and past results in `results.tsv`.
- Decide on a modification that you believe will lower val_bpb.
- Consider what has worked and what hasn't in previous iterations.

## Output format

Once the script finishes it prints a summary like this:

```
---
val_bpb:          0.997900
training_seconds: 300.1
total_seconds:    325.9
peak_vram_mb:     45060.2
mfu_percent:      39.80
total_tokens_M:   499.6
num_steps:        953
num_params_M:     50.3
depth:            8
```

You can extract the key metric from the log file:

```
grep "^val_bpb:" run.log
```

## Logging results

When an experiment is done, log it to `results.tsv` (tab-separated, NOT comma-separated).

The TSV has a header row and 5 columns:

```
commit	val_bpb	memory_gb	status	description
```

1. git commit hash (short, 7 chars)
2. val_bpb achieved (e.g. 1.234567) — use 0.000000 for crashes
3. peak memory in GB, round to .1f (e.g. 12.3 — divide peak_vram_mb by 1024) — use 0.0 for crashes
4. status: `keep`, `discard`, or `crash`
5. short text description of what this experiment tried

Do NOT commit results.tsv — leave it untracked by git.

## The experiment loop

**The first run**: Your very first run should always be to establish the baseline, so you will run the training script as is.

LOOP (up to 200 iterations):

1. Look at the git state: the current branch/commit we're on.
2. Decide on a modification to `train.py` that you believe will lower val_bpb.
3. git commit.
4. Run the experiment: `uv run train.py > run.log 2>&1` (redirect everything — do NOT use tee or let output flood your context).
5. Read out the results: `grep "^val_bpb:\|^peak_vram_mb:" run.log`
6. If the grep output is empty, the run crashed. Run `tail -n 50 run.log` to read the Python stack trace and attempt a fix.
7. Record the results in results.tsv.
8. If val_bpb improved (lower), you "advance" the branch, keeping the git commit.
9. If val_bpb is equal or worse, you git reset back to where you started.
10. Repeat from step 1.

**Timeout**: Each experiment should take ~5 minutes total (+ a few seconds for startup and eval overhead). If a run exceeds 10 minutes, kill it and treat it as a failure (discard and revert).

**Crashes**: If a run crashes (OOM, or a bug, or etc.), use your judgment: If it's something dumb and easy to fix (e.g. a typo, a missing import), fix it and re-run. If the idea itself is fundamentally broken, just skip it, log "crash" as the status in the tsv, and move on.

**NEVER STOP**: Once the experiment loop has begun, do NOT pause to ask the human if you should continue. The human might be asleep, or gone from a computer and expects you to continue working *indefinitely* until you are manually stopped. You are autonomous. If you run out of ideas, think harder — read papers referenced in the code, re-read the in-scope files for new angles, try combining previous near-misses, try more radical architectural changes. The loop runs until the human interrupts you, period.
